            <h4>Stanford Visit #2</h4>
            <p>
              Marty recently went on his second trip to Stanford Cancer Center for a biopsy and follow up visit with his oncologist, Dr. Fan. The CT-guided biopsy was performed on the right flank mass and was done to determine if the mass is still renal cell carcinoma or if the cells had mutated into a different type of cancer (over a period of time cancer cells can change and mutate into different strands). Dr. Fan believes the mass is still kidney cancer but wanted to do this biopsy for research and as a type of "insurance". Depending on the results, they can discover the best way to go about treating the lesion. We are currently waiting for the final report. <br><br>
              Marty saw Dr. Fan and her medical team following the biopsy. We updated her on the completion of his radiation treatment on June 10th. Marty had 10 rounds of radiation to four sites in his body - two in the pelvis, one in the brain and one in the spine. A MRI scan is planned for the beginning of August to determine if the radiation worked. Dr. Fan will review the scans to see if the radiation stabilized the brain lesion. If so it will open the door up to clinical trials that involvement treatment. On a side note- Marty has had the best results with radiation so our fingers are crossed! <br><br>
            In the meantime, Marty is going to start a new oral chemo drug called Votrient for lesions in the lungs, liver and flank. Votrient treats late stage kidney cancer by cutting off the blood supply to the lesion. If the lesion doesn't have blood & oxygen supply via the blood vessels then the tumor will shrink and die. Dr. Fan had suggested Marty take part in an observational clinical trial that would scan the blood vessels attached to the right flank lesion through a high-tech CT scanner that has been recently engineered. Marty would be the third person at Stanford to do this clinical trial. Dr. Fan's hypothesis is that you can tell if a cancer treatment is working or not by looking at the blood vessel growth surrounding the targeted lesion. If the blood vessels have shrinked then the cancer treatment is doing it's job. If the blood vessles haven't shrunk then the treatment isn't working.  The CT scan can show changes in the blood vessels in as little as 7-8 days following the first day of treatment. So for future cancer treatments the time it could take to see if a drug is working can be reduced from months to days. Overall it was a good trip down to Stanford. Marty stayed in Half Moon Bay at a family friend's house and was able to relax and enjoy the ocean views. He will return to Stanford twice in the next month for the 2 CT scans (one scan before he starts Votrient and one scan 8-15 days after he starts the drug). We will keep updates posted!</p><br>
            <h4>Party 4 Marty</h4>
            <p>Thank you to everyone who came out and celebrated Marty's 58th Birthday this past weekend (5/31). Our backyard with filled with laughter, love and friendship. We sincerely hope everyone enjoyed themselves, the food and music. It was a memorable day that we hope Marty will remember for many years to come.<br>

            <h4>Portland Oregon</h4>
            <p>
              Marty and Kathie were surprised with a trip to Portland, Oregon to see “I Love Lucy
              Live”. The show was a reenactment of two I Love Lucy episodes with 50s
              commercials in-between each episode. Sam, Hugh and Jay threw out the welcome
              mat to highlight the best of Portland. Marty toured the beautiful falls while Kathie
              and the girls road the trollie to the shopping district. It was a great weekend
              getaway.

              <p>
              One of Marty's favorite hobbies is following the Cal Bears Women's Softball team. Chuck D'arcy, a good family friend, is the pitching coach for the Lady Bears. Chuck and his wife Nita regularly take Marty down to Berkeley to watch and cheer the girls on. On the last home game of the regular season, Marty and Taylor were treated to the Senior Dinner at the top of the Bears Football Stadium. It was a beautiful and special evening Marty will never forget. Later he received a signed ball from all the players! He calls it his most proud possession and looks forward to next season.</p>

              On May 19th, 2015 Marty and several family members travelled to Palo Alto, CA to
              meet Dr. Fan at Stanford’s Cancer Center. Dr. Fan and her medical team were
              extremely caring and educated. They evaluated Marty’s treatment program and
              we walked away with a positive and hopeful outcome. We will continue to pursue
              this avenue in conjunction with Marty’s local treatment and care.
              <h4>Family Reunion:</h4>
              On Memorial Day weekend two carloads of family traveled from Sacramento, CA to
              the Central Valley for a family reunion at the Ryan Ranch. The Jordan’s, Motta’s, and
              Simonsen’s were able to experience Matthew Ryan and Scott Clark famous BBQ. There
              was great food and wine, mini horses, horseback riding and an olive tree planted for
              our beloved Harriet Ryan who passed away this spring. Overall it was a fantastic
              reunion and the Ryan’s out did themselves.

              A car full of family journeyed down to Chico, CA to watch our little cousin, Mia, début
              as Jane Banks in Mary Poppins. The family grabbed dinner at our local favorite
              restaurant “The Hacienda” and a sweet treat afterwards. The play was well put
              together and Mia truly shined. We expect to see her in many more great
