            <h2>The Jordan Family invites you to join "Team Marty"</h2>
            <!-- <h4>Marty was born June 5, 1957 to Martin and Linda Jordan.</h4> -->
            <p> We are rallying family and friends together on this website to show support for Marty's fight against kidney cancer. <br><br>
          Marty was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma in 2007 during a routine physical. In recent years this illness have become more aggressive causing Marty to retire in November 2014 after 34 active years in the General and Construction Laborers of Northern California. This has allowed Marty to focus full time on his medical and holistic treatments.<br><br>

          Marty has found the positive energy is the best medicine along with spending time with friends and family. We have developed this website as an information conduit to communicate with one another about announcements, updates, "Team Marty" shirts and get-togethers. The support for our family has always been strong and never waned. We would like to kick it up a notch and rev up that positive energy mojo!

         </p>
            <p> Thank you and God Bless you all.</p>

            <h2 style="margin: 1em;">What is he up against</h2>
            <p style="margin: 3em;margin-top: -1em;">Marty was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) in 2007 and had his
              right kidney removed shortly after. In the past years the cancer has slowly
              metastasized into the lungs, liver, spine and brain. After realizing the impact the
              cancer was having on his body he began stronger cancer treatment options such as
              chemotherapy and radiation.<br><br> So far, results have shown the cancer is still acting
              aggressive. Marty has maintained a positive attitude throughout this process and is
              starting to open up and talk about his experience with others. He is currently retired
              and spends lots of time focusing on resting, holistic healing and surrounding himself
            with family and friends.</p>
